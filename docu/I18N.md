# i18n

Our implementation is based on the "classic" Jenkins approach of locale. This means we need to store the translations in a specific format and follow naming conventions.

This means you have to store the translations in the ```src/main/resources``` folder of your Jenkins plugin. To identify the resources you should choose a unique path within the resource directory. This path will become  ```namespace``` of the keys of your plugin.

e.g. ```./jenkins/plugins/blueocean/dashboard/Messages.properties ``` leads to following namespace ```jenkins.plugins.blueocean.dashboard.Messages```. This is true for all resources store in Jenkins. e.g. core resource ```jenkins/management/Messages.properties``` has namespace ```jenkins.management.Messages```

## Submit new translations

You can submit a new PR for french (```fr```) like following

```
# with aliases:
# g=git
# and git aliases
# co=checkout
# nb=checkout -b
# You may have to fork and use that fork
git clone git@github.com:jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin.git
g co JENKINS-35845
g nb JENKINS-39225_fr
```

Then create a locale version for your translation. In our case we will create ```fr```

```
cp ./blueocean-dashboard/src/main/resources/jenkins/plugins/blueocean/dashboard/Messages.properties ./blueocean-dashboard/src/main/resources/jenkins/plugins/blueocean/dashboard/Messages_fr.properties
cp ./blueocean-web/src/main/resources/jenkins/plugins/blueocean/web/Messages.properties ./blueocean-web/src/main/resources/jenkins/plugins/blueocean/web/Messages_fr.properties

```

Then do your translations and [create a new PR in this repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin/pulls). Please link to  ```JENKINS-39225``` in that PR and state which locale you are submitting.

## iso-8859-1 only

Since java properties are supporting only ```iso-8859-1``` (at least in Jenkins core) we need to ensure that all special characters like ```Ã±``` are getting translated into their corresponding utf code ```\u00F1```. There are multiple tools to convert UTF-8 to valid ISO we recommend ```native2ascii``` which comes in each JDK.

```
native2ascii Messages_fr.properties Messages_fr.properties.new
# control that everything is still fine
mv Messages_fr.properties.new Messages_fr.properties
```

## country related variants

We are using traditional java properties based locale as described in [Internationalization: Understanding Locale in the Java Platform](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/locale-140624.html)  you can create region/country and variants codes.

If we want to follow the example of above page and create a new translation for language: "en", country; "US" and variant: "SiliconValley"). We could create a file named:

 ```
 Messages_en_US_SiliconValley.properties
 ```

However best practise is to create first the "common" language and then the country specific one.

```
 Messages_en_au.properties
 Messages_en_US_SiliconValley.properties
```

 Should be

 ```
 Messages_en.properties
 Messages_en_au.properties
 Messages_en_US_SiliconValley.properties
 ```

 where  ``` Messages_en.properties``` is where the general translations are kept and in e.g.  ``` Messages_en_au.properties``` only overrides/adds some keys

Quoting the mozilla wiki page: [Locale Codes](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Locale_Codes) for the identifiers a browser uses to negotiate languages:

> The basic for of our new locale identifiers is  ```<language>-<region>-<dialect>```, where the region and dialect parts are optional.

Further information see [W3C Internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities)

## keys and translations

Our client code is based on [ i18next](http://i18next.com/) so basically you can do everything described there. However since we are using properties and not json format, our keys are flat and cannot be nested.

Further to maintain java compatible we are using numeric arguments for substitutions ```{0}``` in our standard components.

```javascript
  const text = i18n.t('toast.run.stopping', {
    0: name,
    1: runId,
  });
```

with properties:

```properties
toast.run.stopping=Stopping "{0}" #{1}...
```

If you do not care about java you can use as well named parameters ```#~name~#```.

```javascript

  const text = i18n.t('toast.run.stopping', {
    name,
    runId,
    interpolation: {
      prefix: '~#',
      suffix: '~#',
    }
  });
```

with properties:

```properties
toast.run.stopping=Stopping "~#name~#" #~#runId~#...
```

### Plural

> Note: in case you want to use [i18next plural](https://www.i18next.com/plurals.html) you actually have to use the
last example and the param you have to use is `count`

#### With interpolation

```Properties
key.count=__count__ item
key.count_plural=__count__ items
```

and in your code

```javascript
const interpolation = {prefix: '__', suffix: '__'};
const options = (number = 0) => {return {count: number, interpolation}};
console.log(translate('key.count', options()))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(1)))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(2)))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(3)))
```
#### Without interpolation

There is as well a way to have plural without using interpolation. Basically we "trick" the library by passing the `count`
but not using it.

```Properties
key.count={0} item
key.count_plural={0} items
key.count.second={1} item
key.count.second_plural={1} items
```

and in your code

```javascript
const options = (number = 0, position = 0) => {
    const pluralized = { count: number }
    pluralized[position] = number
    return pluralized
}

// then
console.log(translate('key.count', options()))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(1)))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(2)))
console.log(translate('key.count', options(3)))
console.log(translate('key.count.second', options(0, 1)))
console.log(translate('key.count.second', options(1, 1)))
console.log(translate('key.count.second', options(2, 1)))
console.log(translate('key.count.second', options(3, 1)))

```

This way you can still use the keys in your java code.

### Markdown

In case you are having lager paragraph which need to contain some kind of markup, you can use markdown grammar in the value and later parse that.

```javascript
<Markdown>
  {t('EmptyState.branches.notSupported')}
</Markdown>
```

with properties:

```markdown
EmptyState.branches.notSupported=# Ramas no soportadas\nLa construcci\u00f3n de ramas (Branch) solo funciona con el tipo de job _Multibranch Pipeline_. Esto es solo uno de las muchas razones para cambiar a "Jenkins Pipeline".\n\n[M\u00e1s motivos](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline-as-code/)
```
